# The RUST Special Interest Group (SIG)

Rust is a rising star among the programming languages used in embedded and mission-critical systems. In the July 2024 Tiobe Index, it leaped to a new record position, jumping from rank #17 to #13. In the automotive industry, Rust adoption has increased tremendously over recent years. Within the Eclipse SDV, several projects are being written in Rust, e.g. Eclipse SommR or Eclipse Ankaios. In addition, Rust provides a rich ecosystem of open source libraries and tools supported by an active community.
Recognising Rustâ€™s potential to revolutionise the development of safety-certifiable open source software for automakers, this SIG aims to be the premier hub for driving the adoption of the Rust programming language in the automotive industry.

Rust is a Special Interest Group under the Software Defined Vehicle Working Group.  For more information on joining and membership, please visit the Rust SIG page.

SDV Working Group SIGs operate as a non-governing body of the Working Group and inherit and adhere to the SDV Working Group Charter.  SIG goals must align with the goals of the Working Group.

## Mission Statement and General Info

### Rationale

Within Eclipse SDV we see the first projects being written in Rust, e.g. SommR, a SOME/IP implementation, or Ankaios, a workload manager for edge and automotive systems, Eclipse uProtocol, a communication service mesh with key infra written in Rust, and Eclipse Zenoh, a low-latency communications framework.

The Eclipse SDV working group is fostering open source and technical innovation for the transition into the era of software-defined vehicles. We believe that a Special Interest Group for Rust will support its adoption and further strengthen the collaboration between automotive companies, cloud providers and the Rust community.

Rust has the potential to become a foundational enabler for safety-certifiable open source software, the SiG aims to be in the center of that evolution.

The group focuses on work output first and foremost and is rooted in the practical projects Eclipse SDV implements.

### Scope

Initial focus areas of the Rust Special Interest Group are:

* Exchange experience and discuss opportunities and challenges around the adoption of Rust in the automotive and other safety-critical industries
* Engage in community outreach, knowledge exchange and acquisition
* Create and publish documents for practical guidance
* Advise and promote Rust-based SDV projects
* Promotion and potential future creation of open source tooling
* Collaboration with the Rust Foundation on the topic of safety Rust, particularly on coding guidelines
* Recommendations for changes for the upstream Rust project

## About Eclipse Special Interest Groups

Eclipse Special Interest Groups (SIGs) provide a flexible collaborative structure allowing Eclipse members to collaborate around a particular topic or domain within a broader working group. SIGs help bring like-minded working group members together to explore common interests within the scope of the working group. The goal of SIGs is to enable members to share expertise, discovery, best practices and thought leadership.

As an organizing model, and consistent with the working group process itself, SIG members can influence Eclipse projects by engaging in open source processes and/or becoming or supporting committers or contributors on existing projects within the purview of the working group.

* SIGs are collaborations of the willing
* SIGs are a space for thought leadership
* SIGs are open to community engagement

Like working groups, it is incumbent that:

* any working group member may join  
* agendas and minutes of all meetings be made public
* SIGs adhere to the policies of the Eclipse Foundation, including Antitrust, Intellectual Property, Code of Conduct, as outlined in working group charters and the Working Group Process.

## Materials

Special Interest Groups must produce agendas and minutes for all meetings. SIGs have the ability to create artifacts on behalf of the SIG but SIGs must not develop software, software documentation, or specifications as these formal artifact development belongs in Eclipse projects where project governance applies not in a SIG repository.
